# Substitution file
#
# When Makefile line
#
#   DB += abc_motors.db
#
# notices that there is no such *.db file,
# but there is an abc_motors.substitutions file,
# it will expand it.
#
# Reasons to do so:
# 1) In the past, loading one "expanded" file was much faster than
#    loading N separate files
# 2) Personal preference, can "grep" for complete PV name in file,
#    all macros resolved
#
# Nowadays IOC st.cmd file can also use
#
#  dbLoadTemplate "db/abc_motors.substitutions"
#
# and perform the expansion in the IOC
