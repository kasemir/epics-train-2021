# Demo of 'busy' record
#
# Basic idea:
# When writing a "1" to the busy record,
# it remains in the active/busy/processing state
# until something writes a "0" to it.
#
# This example simulates a slow device
# with a "DemoDevice" setpoint
# and a "DemoDeviceReadback" readback
# that slowly follows the setpoint.
#
# Writing to the setpoints sets the busy record.
# Since the DemoDevice has an FLNK & OUT chain
# to the busy record, performing a "put callback"
# via channel access will thus hang while
# the busy record is active.
record(ai, "DemoDevice")
{
    field(DESC, "Setpoint")
    field(FLNK, "DemoDeviceStart")
}

record(ao, "DemoDeviceStart")
{
    field(DOL, "1")
    field(OUT, "DemoDeviceBusy PP")
}

record(busy, "DemoDeviceBusy")
{
    field(DESC, "BUSY Record")
}

# Readback slowly follows the setpoint
record(calc, "DemoDeviceReadback")
{
    field(DESC, "Readback")
    field(INPA, "DemoDeviceReadback")
    field(INPB, "DemoDevice")
    field(CALC, "(A>B)?(A-0.1):((A<B)?(A+0.1):B)")
    field(SCAN, ".1 second")
    field(PREC, "2")
    field(FLNK, "DemoDeviceDone")
}

# When readback matches the setpoint,
# busy record is cleared and a pending
# "put callback" will complete
record(calcout, "DemoDeviceDone")
{
    field(INPA, "DemoDeviceReadback")
